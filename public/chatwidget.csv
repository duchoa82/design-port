"Who are you and what do you do?","My name is **Trương Đức Hoà** - a Product Owner & Associate PM with over 3 years of experience in the tech industry.

My goal is to drive meaningful impact through the synergy of product thinking, tech execution, and speed.

I'm known for my ability to **learn fast** and adapt to emerging technologies, having **built 4 Web3 products and 8 AI agents** from scratch in a short period."
"What projects have you worked on?","I've led and delivered multiple impactful projects, but highlighted:

**4 Web3 products**: Built within 6 months, including NFT platforms and token-gated apps—fully self-taught.

**8 AI agents**: Shipped in 3 months, covering livestream summarization, Q&A bots, and internal chat assistants."
"What is your working process?","## My Working Process
### 1. Requirement Collection
Gather inputs from multiple sources: chats, direct discussions, Figma files (for business/technical changes), and written feedback. Focus on identifying core needs and clarifying business goals.

### 2. Technical Research & Estimation
Run technical feasibility checks in parallel with wireframe discussions. Collaborate with the dev lead and designer to estimate total effort and refine implementation direction.

### 3. Release Planning
Prioritize key and blocking features first, followed by low-effort quick wins. Group features by epic and align them with the current sitemap for structured releases.

### 4. Design – Development – QC
Once stakeholders approve, the team proceeds with design, development, and QA on the dev environment. I write the release notes and define key tracking metrics.

### 5. Demo & Release
Conduct a staging demo when the system is stable and bug-free. Final fixes and prioritized feedback are applied before deploying to production and closing the sprint.

----
### Internal Feedback Loop
**With stakeholders:** I organize focused Q&A sessions (critical questioning) to clarify expectations and align features with business value.

**With DEVs, QC & Design:** Translate requirements into technical terms, gather feedback, and run solution brainstorms across roles."
"What are your career goals moving forward?","I'm looking to join a **vision-driven team**, working on products that **create real impact**, where I can bridge the gap between product, engineering, and business.

I want to continue **exploring the potential of AI**, **shipping** products that are not just **feature-complete but user-validated**, outcome-oriented, and market-ready—from idea to production."
"What are your strengths and weaknesses?","### **Strengths**

- **Structured thinker**: Good at turning vague ideas into clear workflows and bridging tech & business.
- **Self-aware & adaptive**: Understands own limits, prefers long-term growth over chasing hype.
