| 5 | What is your working process? | ## My Working Process ### 1. Requirement Collection Gather inputs from multiple sources: chats, direct discussions, Figma files (for business/technical changes), and written feedback. Focus on identifying core needs and clarifying business goals. ### 2. Technical Research & Estimation Run technical feasibility checks in parallel with wireframe discussions. Collaborate with the dev lead and designer to estimate total effort and refine implementation direction. ### 3. Release Planning Prioritize key and blocking features first, followed by low-effort quick wins. Group features by epic and align them with the current sitemap for structured releases. ### 4. Design – Development – QC Once stakeholders approve, the team proceeds with design, development, and QA on the dev environment. I write the release notes and define key tracking metrics. ### 5. Demo & Release Conduct a staging demo when the system is stable and bug-free. Final fixes and prioritized feedback are applied before deploying to production and closing the sprint. ---- ### Internal Feedback Loop **With stakeholders:** I organize focused Q&A sessions (critical questioning) to clarify expectations and align features with business value. **With DEVs, QC & Design:** Translate requirements into technical terms, gather feedback, and run solution brainstorms across roles. | Working Process | workflow, process, methodology, approach | Active | 2025-08-06 | Updated markdown format |
