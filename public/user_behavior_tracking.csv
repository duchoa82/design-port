## Epic 1: Password Management
This epic encompasses functionalities related to managing user passwords, including resetting forgotten passwords.

**User Story 1:** As an admin, I want to be able to initiate the ""forgot password"" process by providing my email address, so that I can regain access to my account if I've forgotten my password.

```markdown
### Acceptance Criteria (Happy Cases)
- **A/C 1:** Given I am on the login page and have forgotten my password, when I click on the ""Forgot Password"" link, then I should be redirected to the ""Forgot Password"" page.
- **A/C 2:** Given I am on the ""Forgot Password"" page, when I enter my registered email address and click ""Submit"", then a password reset email should be sent to my email address.
- **A/C 3:** Given I have submitted a valid email address, when the system sends the reset password email, then I should see a confirmation message indicating that the email has been sent successfully.

### Acceptance Criteria (Negative Cases)
- **A/C 1:** Given I am on the ""Forgot Password"" page, when I enter an email address that is not registered in the system and click ""Submit"", then an error message should be displayed indicating that the email address is not found.
- **A/C 2:** Given I am on the ""Forgot Password"" page, when I enter an invalid email format (e.g., missing @ symbol) and click ""Submit"", then an error message should be displayed indicating that the email format is invalid.
- **A/C 3:** Given the email service is temporarily unavailable, when I submit my valid email address, then an appropriate error message should be displayed informing me about the issue.
```

**User Story 2:** As an admin, I want to receive a password reset email with a secure, unique link, so that I can securely reset my password.

```markdown
### Acceptance Criteria (Happy Cases)
- **A/C 1:** Given I have requested a password reset, when the email is delivered, then the email should contain a unique and secure link that redirects me to the password reset page.
