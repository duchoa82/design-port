## Epic 1: Password Management
This epic encompasses functionalities related to managing user passwords, including resetting forgotten passwords.

**User Story 1:** As an admin, I want to be able to initiate the ""forgot password"" process by providing my email address, so that I can regain access to my account if I've forgotten my password.

```markdown
### Acceptance Criteria (Happy Cases)
- **A/C 1:** Given I am on the login page and have forgotten my password, when I click on the ""Forgot Password"" link, then I should be redirected to the ""Forgot Password"" page.
- **A/C 2:** Given I am on the ""Forgot Password"" page, when I enter my registered email address and click ""Submit"", then a password reset email should be sent to my email address.
- **A/C 3:** Given I have submitted a valid email address, when the system sends the reset password email, then I should see a confirmation message indicating that the email has been sent successfully.

### Acceptance Criteria (Negative Cases)
- **A/C 1:** Given I am on the ""Forgot Password"" page, when I enter an email address that is not registered in the system and click ""Submit"", then an error message should be displayed indicating that the email address is not found.
- **A/C 2:** Given I am on the ""Forgot Password"" page, when I enter an invalid email format (e.g., missing @ symbol) and click ""Submit"", then an error message should be displayed indicating that the email format is invalid.
- **A/C 3:** Given the email service is temporarily unavailable, when I submit my valid email address, then an appropriate error message should be displayed informing me about the issue.
```

**User Story 2:** As an admin, I want to receive a password reset email with a secure, unique link, so that I can securely reset my password.

```markdown
### Acceptance Criteria (Happy Cases)
- **A/C 1:** Given I have requested a password reset, when the email is delivered, then the email should contain a unique and secure link that redirects me to the password reset page.
- **A/C 2:** Given I have requested a password reset, when the email is delivered, then the email should include clear instructions on how to reset my password.
- **A/C 3:** Given I have requested a password reset, when the password reset email is sent, then the link should expire after a defined period (e.g., 24 hours).

### Acceptance Criteria (Negative Cases)
- **A/C 1:** Given the email server fails to send the email, when I request a password reset, then the system should log the error and provide a means for the system administrator to resend the email.
- **A/C 2:** Given the password reset link has expired, when I click on the link, then I should be redirected to a page indicating that the link has expired and prompting me to request a new password reset.
- **A/C 3:** Given the reset link is generated but the user never uses it, when admin request another link reset password, then old link is invalid and the new link is valid.
```

**User Story 3:** As an admin, I want to be able to reset my password using the link in the email, so that I can create a new, secure password for my account.

```markdown
### Acceptance Criteria (Happy Cases)
- **A/C 1:** Given I have clicked on the password reset link in the email, when I am redirected to the password reset page, then I should be able to enter a new password and confirm it.
- **A/C 2:** Given I have entered a new password and confirmed it, when I click ""Submit"", then my password should be successfully updated.
- **A/C 3:** Given my password has been successfully updated, when I try to log in with my new password, then I should be able to access my account.

### Acceptance Criteria (Negative Cases)
- **A/C 1:** Given I am on the password reset page, when I enter a password that does not meet the defined password complexity requirements (e.g., minimum length, special characters), then an error message should be displayed.
- **A/C 2:** Given I am on the password reset page, when I enter a new password and the confirmation password do not match, then an error message should be displayed.
- **A/C 3:** Given the password reset link has already been used, when I click on the link, then I should be redirected to a page indicating that the link is invalid.

- **A/C 3:** Given a password reset has been initiated, when the password reset is completed successfully by another admin, then I should be able to see which admin initiated the reset.

### Acceptance Criteria (Negative Cases)
- **A/C 1:** Given a password reset attempt fails (e.g., invalid token, password complexity issues), when the attempt fails, then a log entry should still be created indicating the failure and the reason.
- **A/C 2:** Given a log entry is created, when attempting to access the logs without proper permissions, then access should be denied.

## Epic 1: Password Management

**User Story 1:** As an admin, I want to have a ""Forgot Password"" link on the login page, so that I can initiate the password reset process if I forget my password.

```markdown
### Acceptance Criteria (Happy Cases)
- **A/C 1:** Given I am on the login page, when I click the ""Forgot Password"" link, then I am redirected to the password reset initiation page.
- **A/C 2:** Given I am on the password reset initiation page, when I enter my registered email address and click ""Submit"", then I receive an email with instructions on how to reset my password.
- **A/C 3:** Given I click the link in the password reset email, when I am taken to the password reset page, then I can enter and confirm a new password.
- **A/C 4:** Given I have successfully reset my password, when I log in with my new password, then I am successfully logged in to the admin panel.

### Acceptance Criteria (Negative Cases)
- **A/C 1:** Given I am on the password reset initiation page, when I enter an email address that is not registered, then I receive an error message indicating that the email address is not found.
- **A/C 2:** Given I click the link in the password reset email, when the link has expired, then I am taken to a page indicating that the link has expired and I need to request a new password reset.
- **A/C 3:** Given I am on the password reset page, when I enter a new password that does not meet the password complexity requirements, then I receive an error message indicating the password requirements.
- **A/C 4:** Given I am on the password reset page, when the password reset fails due to a system error, then I see an error message that tells me to try again later or contact support.
```

**User Story 2:** As an admin, I want the password reset link to expire after a certain period, so that the reset process remains secure.

```markdown
### Acceptance Criteria (Happy Cases)
- **A/C 1:** Given I request a password reset email, when a password reset email is sent, then the email includes a timestamp for when it expires.
- **A/C 2:** Given a predefined expiration time (e.g., 1 hour), when the user attempts to use the reset link after the time has expired, then the user is prompted to request a new password reset.

### Acceptance Criteria (Negative Cases)
- **A/C 1:** Given a password reset link has expired, when the user attempts to use it, then the system provides a clear error message indicating the link is no longer valid, instead of a generic error.
- **A/C 2:** Given the password reset expiration settings are misconfigured, when a user attempts to reset their password, then the system falls back to a default expiration time and alerts the administrator to the misconfiguration.
```

**User Story 3:** As an admin, I want to receive a confirmation email after successfully resetting my password, so that I am aware that the change has been applied.

```markdown
### Acceptance Criteria (Happy Cases)
- **A/C 1:** Given I successfully reset my password, when the password reset is complete, then I receive a confirmation email.
- **A/C 2:** Given I receive a password reset confirmation email, when I check the email, then it contains information about the successful password change and the date/time of the change.

### Acceptance Criteria (Negative Cases)
- **A/C 1:** Given the confirmation email fails to send after a successful password reset, when I log in with my new password, then I am still able to log in successfully. However, an error log should be created.
- **A/C 2:** Given I receive the password reset confirmation email, when the email contains incorrect or misleading information (e.g. wrong date/time), then there is a mechanism in place to alert support of potential problems.
