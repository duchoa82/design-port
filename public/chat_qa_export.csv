"What is your working process?","## My Working Process
### 1. Requirement Collection
Gather inputs from multiple sources: chats, direct discussions, Figma files (for business/technical changes), and written feedback. Focus on identifying core needs and clarifying business goals.

### 2. Technical Research & Estimation
Run technical feasibility checks in parallel with wireframe discussions. Collaborate with the dev lead and designer to estimate total effort and refine implementation direction.

### 3. Release Planning
Prioritize key and blocking features first, followed by low-effort quick wins. Group features by epic and align them with the current sitemap for structured releases.

### 4. Design – Development – QC
Once stakeholders approve, the team proceeds with design, development, and QA on the dev environment. I write the release notes and define key tracking metrics.

### 5. Demo & Release
Conduct a staging demo when the system is stable and bug-free. Final fixes and prioritized feedback are applied before deploying to production and closing the sprint.

----
### Internal Feedback Loop
**With stakeholders:** I organize focused Q&A sessions (critical questioning) to clarify expectations and align features with business value.

**With DEVs, QC & Design:** Translate requirements into technical terms, gather feedback, and run solution brainstorms across roles.","Working Process","workflow, process, methodology, approach"
