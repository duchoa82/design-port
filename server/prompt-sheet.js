    question: "What are some of the key projects you’ve worked on?",
    answer: `I’ve led and contributed to several impactful projects:\n\n4 Web3 products: Built within 6 months, including NFT platforms, token-gated sites, and blockchain integrations—entirely self-taught.\n\n8 AI agents: Developed in just 3 months, covering use cases like livestream summarization, internal Q&A bots, and AI-powered content tools—all from research to production.\n\nEnd-to-end product operations: Designed and ran a full agile product process—from stakeholder requirement gathering, technical research & estimation, release planning, writing release notes, and demoing to stakeholders, to final production deployment. Tools like ClickUp and Jira helped streamline this process.`

    question: "What is your working process?",
    answer: `### My Working Process
#### 1. Requirement Collection
Gather inputs from multiple sources: chats, direct discussions, Figma files (for business/technical changes), and written feedback. Focus on identifying core needs and clarifying business goals.

#### 2. Technical Research & Estimation
Run technical feasibility checks in parallel with wireframe discussions. Collaborate with the dev lead and designer to estimate total effort and refine implementation direction.

#### 3. Release Planning
Prioritize key and blocking features first, followed by low-effort quick wins. Group features by epic and align them with the current sitemap for structured releases.

#### 4. Design – Development – QC
Once stakeholders approve, the team proceeds with design, development, and QA on the dev environment. I write the release notes and define key tracking metrics.

#### 5. Demo & Release
Conduct a staging demo when the system is stable and bug-free. Final fixes and prioritized feedback are applied before deploying to production and closing the sprint.

----

#### Internal Feedback Loop
**With stakeholders:** I organize focused Q&A sessions (critical questioning) to clarify expectations and align features with business value.

**With DEVs, QC & Design:** Translate requirements into technical terms, gather feedback, and run solution brainstorms across roles.`

    question: "What are your career goals moving forward?",
    answer: `I’m looking to join a vision-driven team, working on products that create real impact, where I can bridge the gap between product, engineering, and business. I want to continue exploring the potential of AI, shipping products that are not just feature-complete but user-validated, outcome-oriented, and market-ready—from idea to production.`
